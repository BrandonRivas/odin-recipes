    <h2>Red Chile Pork Tamales</h2>
    <p>
      While it's common to make tamales all year round, these delicious steamed
      corn husk-wrapped bundles are traditionally made and shared around the
      holidays in Mexico. Everyone has their favorite filling —chicken, beef and
      pork are all popular. In our version, the pork shoulder filling is cooked
      low and slow in a flavorful sauce of dried chiles, aromatics and spices
      and then wrapped in a fluffy, tender masa dough. Enjoy these tamales on
      their own, or with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.

      <li>3 dried pasilla chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried Mexican oregano</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>
        2 1/2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, fat trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces
      </li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>32 dried corn husks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <u>Masa Dough:</u>
    <ul>
      <li>10 ounces lard, such as Manteca</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon chile powder</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>
        4 cups masa harina (instant corn flour) for tamales, such as Maseca
        Tamal
      </li>
      <li>2 1/2 to 3 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
      <li>Lime wedges, for serving, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the braised pork: Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat. Add the onion, 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds
        black pepper and cook until just tender, about 5 minutes. Add the
        chicken broth and guajillo, ancho and pasilla chiles and bring to a
        boil. Cover, turn off the heat and let sit until the chiles have
        softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a blender with the cumin,
        oregano, garlic, 2 teaspoons salt and a few grinds black pepper and
        puree until very smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the sauce back into the Dutch oven, then add the pork and bay
        leaves. Cover and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat
        to medium low to maintain a steady simmer and cook until the pork is
        very tender and the sauce is brick red, 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, soak the corn husks in a bowl of hot water, using a plate to
        keep them submerged, until pliable, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard the bay leaves from the pork, then shred the pork with 2 forks.
        Stir in the apple cider vinegar; taste and adjust the seasoning with
        more salt and pepper. Set aside to cool slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the masa dough: Beat the lard, baking powder, chile powder and 1
        teaspoon salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high
        speed until smooth and light in texture, about 2 minutes.
        (Alternatively, use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.) Reduce
        the speed to low and add the masa harina. Once just incorporated, slowly
        add 2 1/2 cups of the chicken broth and mix until combined, 2 to 4
        minutes. Test the dough by placing a 1/2-teaspoon dollop in a cup of
        cold water--it should float. If not, add the remaining 1/2 cup broth and
        mix until combined, about 2 minutes more. This will ensure that the masa
        dough is light and fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the husks and pat dry. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end of a
        husk, spread about 3 tablespoons of the masa dough down the length of
        the husk, leaving a 1-inch border on the sides. Spoon 2 heaping
        tablespoons of the pork filling down the center of the dough, then fold
        in the sides of the husk, wrapping the dough around the filling. Fold up
        the narrow end of the husk. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and
        filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water.
        Arrange the tamales standing open-end up in the steamer. Bring the water
        to a boil over medium-high heat, then cover and steam until the dough is
        firm, 45 to 50 minutes. Remove from the steamer and cool slightly before
        unwrapping. Serve with lime wedges if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note</h3>
    <p>
      When it comes to the masa dough, the ratio of masa harina, lard and broth
      is very important for the lightest and most tender tamales. Whipping the
      lard first with of touch of baking powder also helps lighten the dough,
      rather than compressing the dough when it’s mixed by hand. We opted for
      dried chiles in this recipe instead of fresh because of their deep, earthy
      flavor. They still pack a punch (in both flavor and heat), but with a
      milder, raisin-like quality. While they’re the same chile, they also have
      different names depending on if they’re fresh or dried. For example, the
      ancho is actually a poblano, the pasilla is a chilaca, and the guajillo is
      a mirasol.
